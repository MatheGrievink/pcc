This repository was created for learning Python with the book Python Crash Cource V2.

# Cheatsheet
This is my documentation for the stuff I learned in the chapters.

## Chapter 1 - Getting started

| variable.upper() | Print all words in UPPERCASE. | " HELLO " |
| variable.lower() | Print all words in lowercase. | " hello " |
| print(f"") | Format-String: print the literal output (With variables). | print(f"{message}, Math√©!") |
| variable.rstrip() | Delete whitespace after string. | " hello" |
| variable.lstrip() | Delete whitespace before string. | "hello "|
| variable.strip() | Delete whitespace from string. | "hello" |
| + - * / ** | Add, subtract, multiply, devide and exponent. | 2 + 2, 2 - 2, 2 * 2, 2 / 2, 2 ** 2|
| 2 2.0 | Integer and floats. | Devide is always float |
| x,y,z = 0,0,0 | Assign multiple variables in 1 line. | first,second,third = 1,2,3 |
| CONSTANT = 1 | Constant,  a variable but should not be changed in a program. | MAX_USERS = 2 |
| #Comment | Add a comment which is ignored by Python. | #This is a commment |

## Chapter 3 - Introducing Lists
| Function | Explanation | Example |
|---|---|---|
| list = ['', ''] | A list of things. Things can be added, modified or deleted. | mountainbikes = ['cannondale', 'trek'] |
| print(list[0]) | Access an element in a list, count starts from 0. | print([0]) (output: cannondale) |
| list[0] = '' | Modify an element in a list | mountainbikes[1] = 'rockrider' |
| list.append('') | Add an element to the end of a list | mountainbikes.append('rockrider') |
| list.insert(0, '') | Insert an element to a position in list. Doesn't change existing elements | mountainbikes.insert(0, 'rockrider') |
| del list[0] | Delete element from list. Element can no longer be used. | del mountainbike[1] |
| popped_list = list.pop(0) | Pop (remove) an element from list (and assign to variable). If no position is defined, the last value is popped | popped_mountainbike = mountainbikes.pop(1) |
| list.remove('') | Same as pop, but now with a specific value | mountainbikes.remove('trek') |
